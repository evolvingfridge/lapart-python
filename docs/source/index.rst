The Laterally Primed Adaptive Resonance Theory (LAPART) neural networks couple two Fuzzy ART algorithms to create a mechanism for making 
predictions based on learned associations. The coupling of the two Fuzzy ARTs has a unique 
stability that allows the system to converge rapidly towards a clear solution. Additionally, 
it can perform logical inference and supervised learning similar to fuzzy ARTMAP.

   LAPART training (shown on the left side) uses two Fuzzy ART (A&B) algorithms connected by an associator matrix (L).
   During training inputs xi are applied to the A-Side while yi inputs are presented ot the B side.
   The algorithm then produces templates and an L matrix.  The testing processes (shown on the right side) 
   has the same structure as the training but applies previously unseen testing data (xi) to the A-Side.
   The algorithm then produces outputs on the B-Side that are the prediction results.
